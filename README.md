1. Question number 1 is in Problem_1.
2. Question number 2 is in Problem_2. There is no proper output right now because it took too much time to compute everything. But the code is correct because it didn't show any errors.
3. Extra credit is in Problem_3. I made the layers for Problem 2.
4. The instruction had a typo on Layer 5 and was repeated twice. In the code, the two layer 5's are divided as 5a) and 5.
